# Final Year Project

This is my Final Year Project

It is a web application named Kloon. Kloon is a music streaming platform that is open and free to all of the users. Music can all be streamed onine with no restrictions or premium plan to unlock new features. 

It is made with the inspiration from Spotify. In here I will try to create a user-friendly interface for users with some extensions of the functionalities apart from just user login.

Overall, I am thinking of the new theme layout for my project and any features to make my project unique and disctinct from Spotify. However, the innitial idead was based on Spotify so it will carry some inherited features or logic in my project
